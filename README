Important setup details can be found here.

Visit https://avix.co/server-hosting for more info on how to setup your own mail server (using this script).

1.You need a "Fully Qualified Domain Name" in order to have your own mail server, so make sure you have one and change the mydomain parameter in super.sh before you run the script.

mydomain="example.com"

2. You need to obtain some signed certificates in order to operate your mail server. If you run the setup script, free self-signed ones will be placed in the correct locations. If you want official certificates, which you most likely will need to get at some point, find a service on the web that will generate them for you. After that; 

place the certificate in: /etc/pki/tls/certs/
Place the private key in: /etc/pki/tls/private/

Also rename the certificate and key file to be "server.pem". This is because the script tells each service to look for server.pem

3. All default passwords will be admin unless you change the default_password variable within super.sh. If you want to create a pasword for a new mail user it is advised that you use the following command, because it will hash and salt your plain-text password, making it much harder to crack;

doveadm pw -p yourpassword -s ssha512 -r 10

By default, when running the script the password specified in the variable will be salted and hashed.
